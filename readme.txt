To run the spider and extract the first indexed 30 pages:

1. In Spider.java, run the Spider.main by IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ, 
   then the database would be generated.

2. In Extract_db.java, run the Extract_db.main by IDE again,
   then spider_result.txt would be generated with the first indexed 30 pages.
